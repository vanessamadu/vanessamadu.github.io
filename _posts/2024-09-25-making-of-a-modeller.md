> **The Making of a Modeller.** Good modelling is a science, the best modelling is an art; how do we equip ocean scientists of the future with the scientific skills to understand our ocean and the creative instincts to model it? For me, it was through the freedom to build, play, and explore mathematical concepts and now I get to use those same concepts to create things much larger than I had ever imagined.
