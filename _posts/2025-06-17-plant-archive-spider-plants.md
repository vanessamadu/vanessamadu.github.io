<small><i class="fas fa-flask"></i> **Experimental Log**: This is part of my ongoing project to understand how my spider plants respond to different environments. These are rough notes — learning in progress. Mistakes allowed.</small>

# Overview

I have a lot of spider plant cuttings, so I’ve decided to experiment with placing them in different light conditions in my office to see how they respond. 

# Aim

To observe how spider plants (Chlorophytum comosum - white edge) respond to varying light levels over time. I’m particularly interested in:

- Leaf colour and vibrancy
- Leaf integrity
- Bushiness vs legginess
- Growth rate
- Signs of stress

# Setup

| Cutting ID | Location | Light Conditions | Container | Notes (with initial conditions - 17/06/2025)|
|------------|----------|------------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| SP-01 (Benji)     | North-facing windowsill | Medium indirect light | Small plastic pot inside a ceramic pot |Small and has some bite marks/holes from snails. |
| SP-02 (Mary-Sue)  | West-facing windowsill | Bright direct light (particularly in the afternoon/evening)| Plastic pot inside a ceramic pot | Some pale blotches and round holes with brown edges. Some leaves have dark tips.|
| SP-03 (Timothy)     | Centre of room width direct line from west-facing window| Medium ambient light (some bright direct light in the afternoons)| Plastic pot inside a ceramic pot | Some pale blotches and bite marks. Otherwise doing well.|
| SP-04-AND-05 (Pinky & Perky) | West-facing shelf | Medium ambient light (indirect bright light in the afternoon/evening) | Plastic pot inside a ceramic pot | One fairly large hole given the size of the leaf. Two small plants sharing a pot |
| SP-06 (Ionna)    | North-facing shelf | Low ambient light | Plastic pot | Small white blotches. |

# Hypotheses

- Plants in brighter locations will grow faster and produce stronger colour contrast.
- Plants in direct sunlight will develop brown marks (burning).
- Plants in direct sunlight will dry out more frequently.

# Schedule

Plan to check in every week with notes and photos.

# Questions I'm Tracking

- How long until visible new growth?
- Do any locations lead to browning or leaf loss?

# Reflection

<small>To be filled in after the first few days.</small>
