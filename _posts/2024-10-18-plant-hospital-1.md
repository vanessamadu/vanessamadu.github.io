# Basic Information

Here's the stats for this plant:

> * **Scientific Name:** Calathea
* **Usual Home:** The PhD office. Until recently, it was on the windowsill that got the most sunlight in the office. Dry air. Warm during the summer.
* **Last Known Healthy State:** Apparently the plant took a turn for the worse over the summer and was responding poorly to watering (?overwatering).

There are a couple of new leaves that appear healthy in the centre of the plant.

# Care Guide

I've never dealt with a calathea before so I had to do some research regarding their care. This is what I found:

<i class = "fas fa-sun"></i> *Light*: Bright indirect sunlight

<i class = "fas fa-droplet"></i> *Water*: Keep soil moist without overwatering. Check if the top few centimeters of soil are dry. Use rain water if possible.

<i class = "fas fa-cloud"></i> *Humidity*: Calatheas prefer high humidity. Mist their leaves or place in a tray of moist pebbles.

<i class = "fas fa-temperature-half"></i> *Temperature*: Keep away from heaters. Calatheas can't tolerate temperatures lower than 13°C. 
* Ideally keep between: 15.5°C - 26.7°C.

# Treatment

18/10/2024 - As an initial intervention, I have:

* Removed the soil affected by the fungal infection.
* Repotted the plant in fresh top soil.
* Sprinkled cinnamon as a preventative.
* Disinfected the pot with a anti-bacterial wipes and cinnamon.
* Pruned dead leaves.
* Watered with rain water
* Misted with filtered water
