##  <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i> 10A: Show a good man has little cruelty (5)

<details><summary><strong>Show Answer + Working</strong></summary>

<strong>Answer:</strong>Revue <br>    
<strong>Type:</strong> Charades <br>
<strong>Working:</strong> <br>    

_ _ _ U _ <br>

This is where my brief stint in the musical theatre society comes in very helpful. I only performed in one show during my time in the society and it was called 'Revue: It's All Happening'. I performed in three musical numbers and found the structure interesting; a collection musical numbers from different popular musicals. I didn't know a revue was at the time or really until I encountered this clue. <br>
<ul>
- 'good man' is referring to a 'reverend' or <b>'rev'</b>. I will be witholding my opinion on the accuracy of that descriptor.<br>
- <b>letter selection indicated</b> by 'little'<br>. Applied to the subsequent word 'cruelty' gives 'ue'
</ul>
\<click\> I performed in a something called a 'revue'! It was a type of 'show'!

<details><summary><strong>Show Answer + Working</strong></summary>

<strong>Answer:</strong> Bath<br>

I liked this one! 'Bath' is a town and it is also something that one (ideally) gets out of clean.

## <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i> 27A: Direction of the asteroids?(4)

<details><summary><strong>Show Answer + Working</strong></summary>

<strong>Answer:</strong> East <br>  
<strong>Type:</strong> Hidden Word <br>  

<strong>Working:</strong>  I expected the solution to this to be some kind of direction, e.g., north, south, left, right. From there it was straightforward to spot, especially given that the answer had four letters:<br>  
<blockquote>
Direction of th<b>E AST</b>eroids?
</blockquote>

</details>

##  <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i> 29A: Possibly hear like an ostrich(4)

## <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i> 32A: Move slowly in church(4)

<details><summary><strong>Show Answer + Working</strong></summary>

<strong>Answer:</strong> Inch <br>    
<strong>Type:</strong> Charades, Hidden Word <br>    
<strong>Working:</strong> 

I anticipated this being a definition for 'move slowly'.

Then I noticed: 

<blockquote>
Move slowly <b>IN CH</b>urch. 
</blockquote>
However, I think 'church' might be an indicator for 'ch', so it could have been 'in' 'ch'.

##  <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i> 33A: Goodbye to a new idea for a uniform(5)

<details><summary><strong>Show Answer + Working</strong></summary>

<strong>Answer:</strong> Adieu <br>    
<strong>Type:</strong> Anagram + Charades
<strong>Working:</strong> <br>    

_ _ _ _ U <br>

I like this one. There are a couple of nice cryptic things here that I liked! <br>
<ul>
- <b>anagram indicated</b> by 'new' <br> for subsequent word 'idea'<br>
- 'uniform' is the phonetic alphabet term for <b>'u'</b><br>
</ul>
Rearranging the letters in 'idea' followed by 'u' results in 'adieu', which is a synonym for goodbye.
</details>

---

## <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i> 34A: Portion of chicken served with teas by old BR(6)

<details><summary><strong>Show Answer + Working</strong></summary>

<strong>Answer:</strong> Breast <br>    
<strong>Type:</strong> Charades <br>
<strong>Working:</strong> <br>    

_ _ _ _ _ T <br>

I am pretty sure I am right but am not totally sound on the reasoning with this one. This word is a 'portion of chicken', with 'BR' 'by' a rearrangement of 'teas' which leads to 'Breast' but I don't know what the indicator is for rearranging 'teas' is.

</details>

---

##  <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i> 35A: On tour, maybe, everyone can go farther(8)

<details><summary><strong>Show Answer + Working</strong></summary>

<strong>Answer:</strong> <br>    

<strong>Working:</strong> <br>    

O _ _ _ _ _ _ _

</details>

---

##  <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i> 36A: Be close to making a lot of noise about a bit of a joke(6)

<details><summary><strong>Show Answer + Working</strong></summary>

<strong>Answer:</strong> Adjoin <br>    
<strong>Type:</strong> Charades <br>
<strong>Working:</strong> <br>    

_ _ _ O _ N <br>

I needed a bit of help with this one because I wasn't familiar with the word 'adin' which means 'a lot of noise'. 'Around a bit of' is an indicator to arrange the letters of 'adin' around 'jo' which is a bit of the word 'joke'!

##  <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i> 18D: City managed by thanes?(6)

<details><summary><strong>Show Answer + Working</strong></summary>

<strong>Answer:</strong> Athens <br>    
<strong>Type:</strong> Anagram <br> 

<strong>Working:</strong> <br>    
_ _ _ E N S<br>

As a half Greek woman, this answer was in my veins. This was helped by that I didn't know what a 'thane' was and so it registered as a weird word. If there is a weird word or idiosyncratic phrase, I've found that it's because the clue needs the letters so check if it's an anagram. 

From there, knowing I was looking for a city and having the last three letters made the answer immediately clear to me.

##  20D: Watch how you pull up going round a bend(5)

## <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i>  23D: Not allowed to be revealed outright(6)

<details><summary><strong>Show Answer + Working</strong></summary>

<strong>Answer:</strong> Barred <br>    
<strong>Type:</strong> Charades <br>

<strong>Working:</strong> <br>    
_ _ _ R _ _ <br>

This is one of those clues that I simultaneously felt very clever for solving but irritated because it felt correct enough to be confident with a justification awkward enough that some doubt remains. Expected a definition here, something that meant 'not allowed'. 'Barred' immediately came to mind because of a few rapid fire realisations: <br>
<ul>
- '<b>bared</b>' is a synonym of 'revealed'<br>
- 'outright' as a rearrangement indicator, to arrange the preceding word, 'bared' around the <b>out</b>side for an '<b>r</b>' as the word 'right' can be an abbreviated to 'r'.
</ul>

##  <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i> 25D: A charge that makes you feel robbed?(3)

## <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i> 28D: Work advanced in West London(5)

<details><summary><strong>Show Answer + Working</strong></summary>

<strong>Answer:</strong> Acton <br> 
<strong>Type:</strong> Charades <br>

<strong>Working:</strong> <br>    

A C _ _ _ <br>

To 'act' is a synonym for 'working' and 'on' is synonymous with 'advanced' as in to 'move on'. Putting 'act' and 'on' together gives 'acton' which is a town in West London.

##  30D: He's said to take on the workers(5)

##  <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i> 31D: Anything that gets a thug drunk(5)

<details><summary><strong>Show Answer + Working</strong></summary>

<strong>Answer:</strong> Aught <br>    
<strong>Type:</strong> Anagram<br>
<strong>Working:</strong> <br>    

</details>

--- <br>

I needed to do a Google search to confirm this one. <br>
<ul>
- <b>anagram indicated</b> by 'drunk'<br>
- <b>aught</b> is an anagram of 'a thug'<br>
- <b>aught</b> is synonymous with 'anything<br>
</ul>

New Word: Aught, which apparently, is an archaic word meaning 'anything at all'.

## <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i> 32D: Villain's first class return on leave(4)

<details><summary><strong>Show Answer + Working</strong></summary>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Iago <br>    
<strong>Type:</strong> Charades <br>
<strong>Working:</strong> <br>    

I _ _ _ <br>

I needed a bit of help with this as well. I vaguely remember Iago as a Villain from a Shakespearean play (turns out that it's Othello) but needed reminding of this. <br>
<ul>
- '<b>ai</b>' as an abbreviation of 'first class'<br>
- <b>reversal indicated</b> by 'return'<br>
- '<b>go</b>' is synonymous with 'leave'
</ul>
