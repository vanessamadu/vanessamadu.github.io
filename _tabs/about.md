I find a lot of things in life very exciting and I like to share my excitement with others. 

As an oceanographically-enabled mathematical statistician, I get to learn lots of exciting science and mathematics, and as a citizen of Planet Earth, I get to learn even more other stuff. I really want to share all the stuff I find interesting but, unfortunately, I am limited by my inability to be in two places at once (not for lack of trying). 

**My solution: my** ~~soap box corner of the internet~~ **website :)**

## What might you find here?

I talk about whatever I find most interesting at the time, but for an indication:

* My PhD 
* Recreational Mathematics
* Random science (however you choose to interpret that has a non-zero probability of being the right way.)
* Ducks! 
* Clouds and other fluid dynamical oddities
* Scientifical things that I have been up to
* Puzzles
* Lessons learned
* Literature
* Scepticism/philosophy

<i class= "fas fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> **For the Attention of Fellow Pedants**: I reserve the right to go rogue and talk about something not on this list :)

# The Official Bio

Vanessa Madu is a PhD student on the EPSRC CDT in Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning at Imperial College London and Oxford University.  She is an "Oceanographically-enabled Mathematical Statistician" ![Desktop View](/assets/img/Vanessa-Madu.jpg){: width="247.35" height="309.2" }{: .left} who is interested in statistical machine-learning methods for predicting ocean surface currents. She is also interested in ocean uncertainty quantification.



Vanessa is also a talented science communicator and has received several awards for her unique, innovative, and successful approaches to making science accessible to general and young audiences. She has also initiated several projects aimed at enhancing diversity within her field, driven by the vision that everyone should be able to enjoy and understand science, regardless of their background.
