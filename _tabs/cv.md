## <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Research Projects

### Robust Models for Time-Varying Signals, Imperial College London
**March 2024 - June 2024**  
<i class="fas fa-university"></i> Supervisor \: Professor Alessandra Luati

- Produced a new and thorough proof of the validity of probability density function (PDF) for a weighted infinite sum of iid uniform variables used in the working paper Robust filtering of a location parameter Catania, L., Harvey A.C. and Luati A. (2024), and provided new insightful proof details.
- Derived a general (novel) PDF for the infinite sum of iid symmetrically distributed random variables with the conditions on the distribution and weights for existence.


### Physically Interpretable Error Metrics for Ocean Surface Models, Imperial College London
**November 2024 - February 2024**  
<i class="fas fa-university"></i> Supervisor \: Dr Adam Sykulski

- Proposed a system of model evaluation and uncertainty metrics for a phenomena-centred ocean surface modelling approach to maximise information gain when learning from ocean data.
- Demonstrated the value of these additional model evaluation metrics for simple drifter velocity model examples. 

### Computational Modelling of the Clustering of Floating Drifters on the Ocean Surface, Imperial College London
**October 2022 - June 2023**  
<i class="fas fa-university"></i> Supervisor \: Professor Pavel Berloff

- Constructed a dynamically inspired (novel) velocity field from a spectral density function to study the clustering of floating tracers in this more realistic field
- Applied data tapering methods from Time Series Analysis to limit the lifetime of each wave involved in constructing the environment, producing a more interesting velocity field
- Produced simulations of the velocity field using Fortran
